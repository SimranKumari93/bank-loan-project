## Problem Statement

This project focuses on building a **Bank Loan Report Dashboard** to monitor and evaluate lending activities.  
It addresses the need for better visibility into loan performance by:

- Tracking key KPIs: loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and DTI ratios.  
- Classifying loans into **Good vs Bad** to assess portfolio quality.  
- Providing visual insights through charts on trends, regions, loan terms, employment, purpose, and home ownership.  
- Offering a **detailed dashboard** for borrower profiles and loan performance.  

The goal is to enable **data-driven decisions** and improve strategic planning in lending operations.
