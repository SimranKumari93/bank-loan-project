The problem statement is about building a Bank Loan Report Dashboard to monitor and evaluate lending activities.

It aims to:

Track key KPIs like loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.

Classify loans into Good vs Bad to assess portfolio quality.

Provide visual insights via charts (trends, regional analysis, loan terms, employment length, loan purpose, home ownership).

Offer a detailed dashboard for quick access to borrower and loan performance data.
